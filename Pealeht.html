<br>
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me <br>
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed <br>
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb <br>
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead <br>
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming <br>
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running <br>
Didn't make sense not to live for fun <br>
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb <br>
So much to do, so much to see <br>
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets? <br>
You'll never know if you don't go <br>
You'll never shine if you don't glow <br>
Hey now, you're an all star <br>
Get your game on, go play <br>
Hey now, you're a rock star <br>
Get the show on, get paid <br>
And all that glitters is gold <br>
Only shooting stars break the mold <br>
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder <br>
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older <br>
But the meteor men beg to differ <br>
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture <br>
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin <br>
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim <br>
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours? <br>
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored <br>
Hey now, you're an all star <br>
Get your game on, go play <br>
Hey now, you're a rock star <br>
Get the show on, get paid <br>
All that glitters is gold <br>
Only shooting stars break the mold <br>
Somebody once asked <br>
Could I spare some change for gas? <br>
"I need to get myself away from this place" <br>
I said, "Yep, what a concept <br>
I could use a little fuel myself <br>
And we could all use a little change" <br>
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming <br>
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running <br>
Didn't make sense not to live for fun <br>
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb <br>
So much to do, so much to see <br>
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets? <br>
You'll never know if you don't go (go!) <br>
You'll never shine if you don't glow <br>
Hey now, you're an all star <br>
Get your game on, go play <br>
Hey now, you're a rock star <br>
Get the show on, get paid <br>
And all that glitters is gold <br>
Only shooting stars break the mold <br>
Hey now <br>
Hey now <br>
Hey, hey, hey now <br>
Hey now <br>
Hey now, you're an all star <br>
Hey now, you're an all star <br>
Hey now, you're an all star <br>
Only shooting stars break the mold <br>  <br>  <br>
